# matlab_comp_vars
Compressed variables in MATLAB workspace

A mini tool that utilizes MATLAB-Java interface to compress variables. 
The compression is carried out in memory and no file-io is involved.

I wrote this tool to mainly keep libsvm model weights from taking too much space in memory. 
Enjoy!
